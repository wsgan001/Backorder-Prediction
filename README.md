# Backorder Prediction Modeling
Personal Data Analysis project of Backorder Prediction using Kaggle dataset 

## Data
I used [data](https://www.kaggle.com/tiredgeek/predict-bo-trial) from Kaggle, which had 1.9 million observations of parts in an 8 week period. The source of the data is unreferenced.

-   **Outcome**: whether the part went on backorder
-   **Predictors**: Current inventory, sales history, forecasted sales, recommended stocking amount, part risk flags etc. (22 predictors in total)

**Update**: The dataset seem no longer available on kaggle website. Do some digging. Its easy to find online. 

## Key considerations of the data:

-   **Imbalanced outcome**: Only 0.7% of parts actually go on backorder.
-   **Outliers and skewed predictors**: Part quantities (stock, sales etc.) can be on very different scales.
-   **Missing data**: A few variables have data that are missing (not at random).
-   **n&gt;&gt;p**: There are many observations (1.9 million) relative to the number of predictors (22).

## Usage & Installation

### Dependencies
- pandas: read / write csv file
- numpy: data format
- sklearn: classifiers
- Imbalanced-learn 0.2.1

### Install
``` pip install requirements.txt```


## Tasks
### Data Wrangling 
- [x] Handling inconsistent column names and datatype
- [x] Missing Data handling
- [x] Removal of duplicate rows
- [x] Handling columns with repetitive values
- [x] Handling the outliers
- [x] Write the clean data into a new file for further steps

### Data trend analysis

- [] Relationship among features
- [] Data questioning

### Model training and validation

- [] train-test split of the data
- [] Model training
- [] Model Tuning and cross validation

## Tests
- Training sample order_classifier.build_classifier_sample()
- Evaluating sample order_classifier.eval_result_rf()

## API Reference
- Training from csv data-file and writing model to model-file order_classifier.training_from_csv_data(data_file, model_file)
- Loading model from model-file order_classifier.readModel(file_path)
- Read from file and convert data to numpy format order_preprocess.read_data(file_path)
- Predict order_classifier.predict(data, classifier)
